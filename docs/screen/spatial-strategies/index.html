    <!-- <h2>Spatial Strategies</h2> -->

    <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spatial-strategies/id1041589132?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Spatial Strategies is available on the iOS app store.</a></p>
<p>Spatial Strategies is an iOS app which facilitates walks through diverse environments which are free of a linear objective. Its goal is to set up a context to become hyper aware; and observe your surroundings in detailed, aesthetic ways. Users specify a duration of the walk as well as set an interval for messages that they receive which guide the experience. It draws from influences from The Derive (Guy Debord) and Oblique Strategies (Brian Eno). </p>
<p>This project was initiated while in residence at <a href="https://www.blasttheory.co.uk/">BLAST THEORY</a> at 20 Wellington Road. Parts of this activity are made possible by a research grant from <a href="https://forecastpublicart.org/">Forecast Public Art</a> and the <a href="https://www.jeromefdn.org/">Jerome Foundation</a>.</p>
