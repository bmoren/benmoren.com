    <!-- <h2>A collaborative project between Matthew Lawler and Myself for the Art of This SUMMER open Residency program.</h2> -->

    <p>The work revolves around two diverse thematic ideas, education and video game culture.  While exploring how these ideas play off of and into each other, two main works were created. A series of drawings by Matthew and a projection and controller installation by Ben Moren. Lawler&#39;s drawings explore anomalies in space and are presented in a way that breaks the human idea of perspective. Moren&#39;s educational video game interface, which is modeled on a classic school desk, allows users to navigate a three dimensional recreation of the gallery space in real time where virtual versions of Lawler&#39;s drawings stare there physical versions on the opposing wall. The virtual versions have the perspective Lawler&#39;s drawings break corrected digitally. Doritos and Mountain Dew were served at the opening.</p>
