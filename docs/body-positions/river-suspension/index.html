    <!-- <h2>River Suspension</h2> -->

    <p>River Suspension (2013) relies on a similarly simple poetic device. Arresting a jump in mid-air, the artist captures and loops the moments right before his body succumbs to gravity. Suspending his fall into the water, he seems to levitate. River Suspension points to Moren’s interest in tipping points: the moments right before something happens that divides the passage of time into a before and after.</p>
