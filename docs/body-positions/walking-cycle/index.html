    <!-- <h2>Walking Cycle</h2> -->

    <p>Ben Moren’s Walking Cycle (2013) immerses the viewer in a pentagonal arrangement of projection screens. The artist, the sole protagonist in the videos, navigates through different landscapes. The walking figure appears on only one screen at a time, creating the illusion of movement from screen to screen. Of course, viewers well versed in the visual grammar of Hollywood habitually suspend disbelief to enjoy cinematic adventures; editors routinely condense or slow down time, as storylines demand. Synchresis, the unity forged of image and sound, means to guarantee a seamless, perfectly calibrated experience. Moren breaks with the customary poetics of cinematic manipulation. Instead, he relies on long shots in real time. At first, it seems like nothing much happens. Then, a certain oddity of movement and a discrepancy of sound and image become hard to ignore. Something is definitely off. </p>
<p>As Moren leans toward a steep hillside on screen, steadies himself, and brushes past branches and undergrowth, the halting, hesitant quality of his movements is mesmerizing. Walking Cycle’s secret, once revealed, is simple: Moren trained himself to walk backwards through uneven terrain but reverses the recording. In order to avoid collisions and injuries, he had to learn how to use his peripheral vision and to maneuver—awkwardly, slowly, counter-intuitively— backward. “The body ‘knows’ what its muscular and skeletal actions and posture are in any movement or action, quite independent of any knowledge of physiology or how the body functions. I am able to pick up a pebble and throw it without reflecting on how I am to do it,” writes Elizabeth Grosz.<sup>3</sup> Walking Cycle replaces such instinctive somatic knowledge with carefully complicated action dependent on a heightened degree of physical awareness.</p>
<p>“By considering the body in movement, we can see better how it inhabits space (and possibly time) because movement is not limited to submitting passively to space and time, it actively assumes them, it takes them up in their basic significance which is obscured in the commonplace of established situations,” suggests Merleau-Ponty.<sup>4</sup> Indeed, the conditions of human mobility, enabled “by our two-leggedness and the position of the head at the top of the body, with two eyes pointed forward,” have encouraged “the production of widespread analogies between a future ‘in front of us’ and the past ‘behind us’.” <sup>5</sup> Rather than fade into the invisibility of the familiar, walking, in Moren’s reversal, draws attention to human embodiment, our relations to space, and perceptions of time, while actively challenging our trust in what we think we see. </p>

<!-- Walking Cycle is a large free-standing video installation made of four eight-foot-high walls covered in translucent projection material forming a pentagonal shaped room. Each of the four walls carries a video projection of a young male figure walking through a hilly natural landscape of trees and forests. The figure awkwardly moves across the landscape and from screen to screen, arising from and eventually disappearing behind the horizon. At first glance my movements appear natural, but as the viewer focuses their attention, my slightly twitchy and spasmodic movements (caused by video playing in reverse) become more apparent. This sense of awkwardness in gait and gesture is difficult to decipher causing the view to question the reality of what they are observing. &#x201C;What is he doing?&#x201D; &#x201C;Why does seem that he has so little control over his body?&#x201D; &#x201C;What is happening?&#x201D;

To focus the viewers attention on the moving figure the video projected on to the other three screens remains still as he moves from the frames edge and disappears into the distance. As the performer leaves the frame and enters the next screen, that screen is activated and the previous screen&#x2019;s action comes to a halt. The installation creates a perpetual loop as the performer continually repeats his ungainly journey across the four screens; the cyclical non-linear system repeats indefinitely and is programmed to play in a non-repeating-randomized loop eliminating the possibility of repetition from screen to screen. -->
